How to automate with the vSphere module.

I can create a VM, but immediately after it is powered on, I must either

* rename the VM, or
* join it to Active Directory with a new name

How can I push commands to take immediate effect on a Puppet client rather than wait for the Puppet Agent on the client to pull a command from the Puppet Master?

  Install agent command - sent through
