## Description

Manage the sudoers commands for the vrouser.  This allows VMware VRO/VRA to remove and destroy a node, with limited sudo commands.  The point is to have a non-elevated user to run commands to remove/destroy puppet nodes that were created through VRO/VRA workflows.

## Usage

Used in conjunction with other VRO/VRA modules
